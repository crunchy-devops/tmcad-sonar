Sure! Here’s how you can rewrite the `Point3D` concept using **NumPy** for better performance and memory efficiency, especially if you're working with **many points**.

---

### ✅ Single Point using NumPy structured array:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a structured dtype for a single 3D point
point_dtype = np.dtype([('x', 'f4'), ('y', 'f4'), ('z', 'f4')])

# Create one point
point = np.array((1.0, 2.0, 3.0), dtype=point_dtype)

print(point)
print(f"x={point['x']}, y={point['y']}, z={point['z']}")
```

---

### ✅ Array of Points (great for performance!):

```python
import numpy as np

# Structured dtype for 3D points
point_dtype = np.dtype([('x', 'f4'), ('y', 'f4'), ('z', 'f4')])

# Create an array of points
points = np.array([
    (1.0, 2.0, 3.0),
    (4.0, 5.0, 6.0),
    (7.0, 8.0, 9.0)
], dtype=point_dtype)

# Accessing components
print("All X coords:", points['x'])
print("First point Z:", points[0]['z'])
```

---

### ✅ Why use this approach?

- **Memory Efficient:** `'f4'` is 32-bit float (vs Python’s default 64-bit float).
- **Fast Vectorized Ops:** You can do operations across all points easily:

```python
# Translate all points by a vector (1, 1, 1)
points['x'] += 1
points['y'] += 1
points['z'] += 1
```
